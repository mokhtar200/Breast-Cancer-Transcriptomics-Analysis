# Breast Cancer Transcriptomics Analysis
 
## Overview
This project explores transcriptomic data to identify molecular markers and biological insights in breast cancer. Using real-world datasets, the workflow includes differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, pathway enrichment, survival analysis, and visualization.

## Goals
1. **Differential Gene Expression (DGE):** Identify genes significantly expressed in breast cancer vs. normal tissue.
2. **Pathway Enrichment Analysis:** Uncover biological pathways associated with breast cancer.
3. **Survival Analysis:** Explore gene expression's impact on patient survival.
4. **Biomarker Discovery:** Identify potential diagnostic or prognostic markers for breast cancer.

## Dataset
The RNA-Seq data and associated metadata were sourced from [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) - BRCA Project.

## Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Download breast cancer RNA-Seq data from TCGA.
   - Organize into `data/` directory.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Normalize data using DESeq2.
   - Filter lowly expressed genes.

3. **Differential Gene Expression Analysis:**
   - Perform DGE analysis to identify significantly expressed genes.

4. **Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - Use KEGG to identify enriched pathways.

5. **Survival Analysis:**
   - Correlate gene expression with patient survival outcomes.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Generate heatmaps, volcano plots, and Kaplan-Meier plots.

## Requirements
The following R packages are required:
- `TCGAbiolinks`
- `DESeq2`
- `clusterProfiler`
- `survival`
- `survminer`
- `pheatmap`
- `EnhancedVolcano`

Install them in R using:
```R
install.packages(c("TCGAbiolinks", "DESeq2", "clusterProfiler", "survival", "survminer", "pheatmap"))
BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano")
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BreastCancerTranscriptomics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd BreastCancerTranscriptomics
   ```
3. Open and run the scripts sequentially in RStudio.

## Results
1. **Differential Gene Expression:**
   - Top significantly expressed genes are stored in `results/DGE_Results.csv`.
2. **Pathway Enrichment:**
   - Enriched pathways are listed in `results/Pathway_Results.csv`.
3. **Visualizations:**
   - Heatmaps and volcano plots demonstrate differential expression trends.
